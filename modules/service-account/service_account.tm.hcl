# This file is part of Terramate Configuration.
# Terramate is an orchestrator and code generator for Terraform.
# Please see https://github.com/terramate-io/terramate for more information.
#
# To generate/update Terraform code within the stacks
# run `terramate generate` from root directory of the repository.

# This file is defined on a very high level to simulate code deduplication between
# different environments. The same code will be used in staging and production
# triggered by /stacks/{environment}/service-accounts/use_service_account.tm.hcl
